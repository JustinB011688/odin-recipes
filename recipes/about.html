    <p class="about">I am new to the tech industry. I am teaching myself the fundamentals of coding in html, css, and javascript at the curent time. My ultimate goals are to eventually land a job in the tech industy as a software developer. I have always been interested in computers and programming but never actually took the time to sit down and learn how it works til now in my 30s. I feel this is goin to be a very difficult journey but at the end of it all i hope to end up with a rewarding career.</p>
